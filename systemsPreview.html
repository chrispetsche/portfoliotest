                        the possibility of a call error is lessened, if not removed. Logic being that 
                        the calls obvious effect pieces of the html code above, and if the system is 
                        reading from the top down, the information it's effecting has to be created to
                        be effected. If the scripts were placed at the top of the html, the chance of
                        getting an error saying something like, "This element does not exist!", is much
                        higher because the browser hasn't read down the page far enough to find it. So,
                        create... then effect!!  -->

    to each display on the page. Following the same logic as to why all the scripts
    are placed at the bottom of the page, the individual scripts are placed based on
    the same thought of 'create then effect'. So the objects and their information are
    created before... -->

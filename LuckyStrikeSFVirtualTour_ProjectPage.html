                        created for web, mobile and VR displays would broaden the ability for clients to view the venue and what it has to offer

                        the bay, its once loved theme and feel have faded and are in need of rediscovery. Building a tour such as this comes with 
                        dual opportunities as the Lucky Strike Corporation can use the tour to also view suggestions on exploring what a new, 
                        refreshing feel might be, with a few suggestions already having been applied as this project has evolved.

                            It actually began as a simple modeling project to show how a particular wall in the venue might be done differently. Most 
                            people that have seen the wall agree that the wall paper used to decorate it is unpleasant to look at, and it really just 
                            doesn’t fit anywhere with the original theme. And so I was asked for some suggestions from the local management, them

                            I used the project as a way of testing and honing some of my skills after grad school. Alot was learned during school of 
                            course, and I wanted to apply that knowledge to a few small projects to develop my personal methods on doing the things I

                            At the time this page was created, the project is still rough and only the local management of Lucky Strike SF have seen it. 
                            A few of the ideas suggested in the different versions have been applied, and some are approved but awaiting funding. So 
                            whether or not corporate will use the project for either purpose in its entirety is unknown.
                        </p>

                            The virtual tour that shows all this was originally constructed to be a downloadable VR experience. The first few versions 
                            built to test the limits of how it would perform on the new platform, as the original Oculus consumer version hadn’t yet 
                            launched  [Section features to be included: images of previous build versions]. However, after a recent temporary loss of 
                            access to a VR system and the needs that came with learning how to build this portfolio site, another expansion to the 
                            project was realized and inspired.

                            Having gotten to know several features of the Unity game engine, it being a personal preference so far in my progress as a 
                            designer and developer, most things were learned specifically for the creation of VR experiences. Without a system to test 
                            and develop on though, a different route was to be taken in order to keep moving forward. During school, some web based 
                            games were touched on only slightly. But in thinking about how to proceed with this project with the most effective outcome 
                            for its purposes, getting to know the WebGL side of Unity seemed like the best path.

                        be effected. If the scripts were placed at the top of the html, the chance of
                        getting an error saying something like, "This element does not exist!", is much
                        higher because the browser hasn't read down the page far enough to find it. So,
